Some scripts that I have written or modified for use with the popular IRC
client, [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/)

# monitorwin.pl

Originally forked from [znxster's hilightwin.pl](https://github.com/znxster/irssi-scripts/blob/master/hilightwin.pl).

## Description 

From the script comments:

> Instead of printing hilights in a window named 'hilight', this will print
> all public messages to a window named 'm', unless the message was destined
> to the active window (to avoid duplicates of the message showing up).
